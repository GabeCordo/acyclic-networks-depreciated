Description: # SCMS Protocol ~ Secure Communication and Messaging Protocol
        
        ## Description
        
        A (S)ecure (C)ommunication and (M)essaging (S)ervice is a lightweight framework at the application layer of the OSI model. Promoting the use of decentralized architectures involving messaging, data-storage, and API-requests.
        
        * TCP Socket Networking 
        * Uses the SORL (Syntax) Language
        * Default asymmetric encryption (RSA keysets) and salting that can be toggled
        * Out of the box packet-routing (tor-like) capabilities for message-origin concealment
        	1. Relays
        	2. Entry/Exit Nodes
        	3. Indexing Server (Creating IP-ID Account related pairs)
        * Customizable Traffic Receivers/Transfer Routines
        
        ### Installation
        
        	pip install quickscms==1.1.6

        ## Extensions
        
        ### SORL
        [Segment Oriented Routing Language](https://github.com/GabeCordo/scms-protocol/tree/master/extensions/sorl) is a (simplistic) syntactical structure for encapsulating encoded-data required for segmented("stage") routing blocks. 
        
        * [Documentation] (https://github.com/GabeCordo/scms-protocol/tree/master/extensions/sorl/docs/markdown.md)
        
        ### Manakin
        [Manakin](https://github.com/GabeCordo/scms-protocol/tree/master/extensions/manakin) is a command-line interface for interacting with the SCMS frameworks built-in server tools. This allows nodes, traffic-managements, logging, scheduling, and events to be initialized with minimal overhead.
